            <h5>Teaching our CSS to play nice</h5>
            <p>
              Talk abstract: As our websites, applications and teams grow larger and more complicated, so does our CSS. 
              Before we know it, we find ourselves no longer with cute little stylesheets, but sprawling, surly teenaged CSS that doesn&#8217;t always play nice with others. 
              We need to learn how to manage and optimize our CSS no matter how large the project or diverse the team. 
              If we start early, we can use best practices and tools to raise full-grown stylesheets any designer or developer would be happy to work with.
